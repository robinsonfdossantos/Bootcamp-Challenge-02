# 02-CHALLENGE

## Description

This challenge showed me how to manage and simplify the interaction between the HTML code (index.html) and the CSS code (styles.css). Also, I was able to better undertand each element of the code while taking notes to explain the lines and ensure how style and placement of the elements in the code are crucial to debugging them by a reverse engineering analysis.

The changes made were an important tool to deepen the analysis of each line whether they could be able to be aggregated to other sections of the code to summarize and keep it cleaner.

Based on user story to attend all the requirements of the acceptance criteria, such as, interaction and faster navigability, all image assets have been resized to have a faster page upload.

Therefore, each single information is an essential step for us to look at future improvements that will come with each new challenge.
